# N-Spring-Solver

This repository contains a numerical solver for a N-degree-of-freedom spring mass damper system.

## Introduction
This solver user explicit Euler and 4th-order Runge-Kutta to numerically solve a system of ODEs and obtain the corresponding position and velocity of each mass over time. 

## System of Interest 
The spring mass damper system of interest in shown below
